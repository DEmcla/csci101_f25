## OVERALL TIME FEASIBILITY

### Realistic Time by Student Level:

| Student Level | Part A | Part B | Part C | Review | TOTAL |
|--------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| **Strong** | 9 min | 24 min | 30 min | 6 min | **69 min** ✅ |
| **Average** | 10 min | 27 min | 34 min | 4 min | **75 min** ✅ |
| **Slower** | 11 min | 30 min | 38 min | 0 min | **79 min** ⚠️ |

### Analysis:

✅ **Strong students (top 25%):** Finish in 69 minutes
- 6 minutes for review
- Comfortable, low stress

✅ **Average students (middle 50%):** Finish in ~75 minutes
- **PERFECT FIT!**
- 4 minutes for review
- Manageable, appropriate time pressure

⚠️ **Slower students (bottom 25%):** Need 79 minutes
- 4 minutes over
- Will need to work efficiently
- May sacrifice some review time
- **This is acceptable** - some time management pressure is normal

## COMPARISON: ALL VERSIONS

| Version | Questions | Time | Avg Student Needs | Buffer | Status |
|---------|-----------|------|-------------------|--------|--------|
| Original | 40 | 75 min | 88 min | -13 min ❌ | Too tight |
| Revised | 37 | 85 min | 78 min | +7 min ✅ | Good (but 85 min) |
| **FINAL** | **35** | **75 min** | **75 min** | **0 min** ✅ | **Perfect fit** |

**Key insight:** Removing 5 questions total (40→35) makes the exam fit 75 minutes perfectly for average students.

## FINAL ASSESSMENT

### Time Feasibility Score: **9.0/10** ✅

**Breakdown:**
- Strong students: 10/10 (lots of time)
- Average students: 9.5/10 (perfect fit)
- Slower students: 7.5/10 (4 min over, manageable)

### Why This Works:

1. ✅ **Average student perfect fit** - 75 min needed, 75 min given
2. ✅ **Strong students comfortable** - 6 min buffer for review
3. ✅ **Canvas + hand-drawing** - Makes drawing questions fast
4. ✅ **Technical accuracy** - Q18, Q35 fixed
5. ✅ **Comprehensive coverage** - Still hits all major topics
6. ✅ **Appropriate difficulty** - 100-level appropriate
7. ✅ **Good point distribution** - Granular grading possible

### Questions Removed (Strategic):

**Q13 (Cardinality definition):** 
- Definition still tested in Q31 (MC: cardinality constraints)
- Not losing content coverage

**Q28 (BCNF determinant rule):**
- BCNF is light coverage anyway (as intended)
- Still mentioned in Q22 answer key context

**Q32 (Why 3NF sufficient):**
- Concept still covered in teaching materials
- Students still need to understand 3NF (heavily tested)
