# CSCI 101 - GitHub Tutorial

## Getting Started

**This is a two-session tutorial:**

1. **Session 1:** Complete `github-setup-guide.html` first (distributed separately)
2. **Session 2:** Then follow `GIT-SETUP-TUTORIAL.md` in this repository

## The Three Pull Requests

Each PR requires a `README.md` + one file:

| Folder | Assignment | What You Submit |
|--------|------------|-----------------|
| pullrequest_01/ | Word Document | README.md + Assignment.docx |
| pullrequest_02/ | Python Program | README.md + helloWorld.py |
| pullrequest_03/ | Markdown File | README.md + markdown_demo.md |

## Branch Structure

- `main` - Course materials (sync from here)
- `submissions` - Where your PRs get merged (submit PRs here)

**When creating a Pull Request, always set the base branch to `submissions`!**

## Files in This Repository

- `GIT-SETUP-TUTORIAL.md` - Session 2 tutorial (start here after Session 1)

- `pullrequest_01/` - Folder for PR 01 submissions

## Important
