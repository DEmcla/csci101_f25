## Isaac Morse - "AI Models: Why They Are Only as Good as Their Data"

**Total Score: 16/20 (80% - B)**

### Content Quality & Clarity: 8/10 (Good - B range)

**Strengths:**
- **Clear thesis**: The central argument that "AI models are only as good as their data" is well-articulated and consistent throughout
- **Good source variety**: Uses five credible sources including peer-reviewed journals (Korteling et al. 2021, Goldfarb & Lindsay 2022), educational articles (Truong 2024, Zhang 2024), and magazine piece (Gonsalves et al. 2023)
- **Personal examples**: The golf caddie app example (page 2) effectively illustrates the "garbage in, garbage out" principle in a relatable way
- **Balanced perspective**: Addresses both limitations and benefits of AI
- **Strong synthesis**: Sources are well-integrated throughout to support arguments rather than listed separately
- **Good organization**: Logical flow from introduction → examples → benefits → philosophical debate → human role → conclusion
- **Clear focus**: Stays on topic throughout the paper

**Areas for Improvement:**
- **Some repetition**: The core argument is restated multiple times without always deepening the analysis
- **Philosophical claims need more nuance**: The assertion that "AI cannot and will never be superior to human intelligence" (page 1) is presented as fact but is actually debatable and needs more nuanced treatment
- **Missing counterargument**: Unlike Hunter's paper, there's no explicit engagement with opposing views or more nuanced perspectives on AI capabilities (e.g., AI surpassing humans in specific domains)
- **Could use more specific examples**: Beyond the golf app, more concrete examples, statistics, or case studies would strengthen claims
- **Conclusion is primarily summary**: Could be strengthened with implications or recommendations

### Writing Quality & Mechanics: 8/10 (Good - B range)

**Strengths:**

**Grammar & Style:**
- Generally clear, readable prose
- Good sentence variety
- Effective use of rhetorical questions (page 3: "Where did the information come from? Humans.")
- Strong topic sentences guide reader through argument
- Personal voice makes the topic accessible without being too informal
- Well-developed paragraphs

**APA Format - Strong:**
- **Proper title page format** (page 1) with all required elements
- **Consistent in-text citations** throughout:
  - Korteling et al. (2021) - page 2
  - Truong (2024) - page 3
  - Goldfarb and Lindsay (2022) - pages 3, 4
  - Zhang (2024) - page 4
- **Well-formatted reference list** (page 6):
  - Proper hanging indent
  - Alphabetized correctly
  - Includes DOIs for journal articles
  - URLs for web sources
  - Proper italicization of titles

**Voice:**
- Maintains generally professional academic tone
- Effective use of first-person when discussing personal example

**Areas for Improvement:**

**Grammar & Style Issues:**
- **Informal language** appears occasionally:
  - "this big stipulation" (page 1) → "common misconception"
  - "people are just hung up on" (page 3) → "people focus excessively on"
  - "On the flip side of things" (page 2) → "Conversely" or "Additionally"
  - "On the other hand" → used appropriately but could vary transitions
- **Absolute statements** could be more nuanced:
  - "AI cannot and will never be superior" (page 1) - too definitive for academic writing
  - Consider: "Current AI systems lack human-like reasoning capabilities"
- **Repetitive phrasing**:
  - "good data" / "bad data" / "false data" appears frequently without variation
  - Consider alternatives: "high-quality datasets," "biased training data," "inaccurate inputs," etc.
- **Wordiness**: Some sentences could be more concise

**APA Issues:**
- **Direct quotes need page/paragraph numbers**:
  - Page 3: The Truong quote "AI offers a chance to enhance human capabilities, not replace them." needs (Truong, 2024, para. X) or page number
  - Page 3: The Goldfarb & Lindsay quote "AI excels at prediction, but judgment… remains a uniquely human responsibility." needs page number: (Goldfarb & Lindsay, 2022, p. X)
- Minor: Some citations could use page numbers even for paraphrases to help readers locate specific claims

**Specific Examples Needing Revision:**

Page 1:
```
"There is this big stipulation where most people see this new technology as being 'smarter' than any human"
```
Better:
```
"A common misconception is that this technology is 'smarter' than human intelligence"
```

Page 3:
```
"But in reality, people are just hung up on how fast it can do things."
```
Better:
```
"However, this perception stems primarily from AI's processing speed rather than genuine intelligence"
```

Page 1:
```
"AI cannot and will never be superior to human intelligence"
```
Better:
```
"Current AI systems lack the reasoning, creativity, and ethical judgment that characterize human intelligence"
```

### Recommendations for Revision:

**Priority Items:**

1. **Add a counterargument section** - Address views that AI might, eventually, match or exceed human capabilities in certain areas. This will strengthen your argument by showing you've considered opposing perspectives.

2. **Track down two more specific examples with data** to support your claims about AI's limitations. Your golf app example is great—add similar concrete examples with statistics or case studies.

3. **Strengthen the conclusion** by adding implications or recommendations (call to action!). Don't just summarize—tell readers what they should do or think about moving forward.

4. **Add page numbers to direct quotes** (APA requirement):
   - Page 3: Truong quote needs (Truong, 2024, para. X) or page number
   - Page 3: Goldfarb & Lindsay quote needs page number

**Additional Improvements:**

5. **Revise informal language** to maintain consistent academic tone throughout:
   - "this big stipulation" → "common misconception"
   - "people are just hung up on" → "people focus excessively on"
   - "On the flip side of things" → "Conversely" or "Additionally"

6. **Vary vocabulary** - use synonyms for repeated phrases like "good data/bad data" (try "high-quality datasets," "biased training data," "inaccurate inputs," etc.)

7. **Soften absolute claims** - Instead of "AI cannot and will never be superior," try "Current AI systems lack the reasoning, creativity, and ethical judgment that characterize human intelligence"

### Overall Assessment:

This is a solid first draft that demonstrates good research, clear thinking, and strong writing skills. Isaac has done an excellent job integrating sources throughout the paper, using proper APA in-text citation format, and maintaining focus on the central thesis. The personal golf app example is particularly effective at making abstract concepts concrete and relatable.

The paper's main content weakness is the tendency to present debatable philosophical claims as settled facts. The argument would be stronger with more nuanced treatment of AI capabilities and explicit engagement with counterarguments. The writing is generally strong with good APA formatting—significantly better than Jackson's paper and comparable to Hunter's in terms of citation practice (though Hunter's content analysis is slightly more sophisticated).

With the revisions suggested above, this could easily move into the A range. The foundation is strong; it mainly needs refinement and additional depth.

## Jackson Trombley - "Social Media Filter Bubbles"

**Total Score: 13/20 (65% - D)**

### Content Quality & Clarity: 7/10 (Satisfactory - C range)

**Strengths:**
- Clear topic focus on social media filter bubbles and their effects
- Shows basic understanding of echo chambers and recommendation algorithms
- References three credible sources (Pariser 2011, Cinelli et al. 2021, Duskin et al. 2024)
- Addresses both pros and cons of filter bubbles
- Attempts to offer practical solutions (recommending both sides of issues, toggle feature for recommendation systems)
- Accessible, conversational writing style makes the topic approachable

**Areas for Improvement:**

- **CRITICAL: Missing in-text citations**: No APA in-text citations anywhere in the draft. Every claim from a source must have a parenthetical citation
  - Paragraph 2: Mentions "Pariser in 2011" and "an article called 'The echo chamber effect on social media'" but provides NO citations
  - Should be: "Pariser (2011) demonstrates..." and "Cinelli et al. (2021) found that..."

- **Extremely shallow analysis - no depth**: Sources are mentioned but never explained
  - Paragraph 2: You mention what sources say but don't engage with their specific findings, data, or examples
  - What data did Cinelli et al. provide about echo chambers? What were their key findings?
  - What specific examples does Pariser give in his book?
  - What did Duskin et al. discover in their Twitter audit? You never actually discuss this source
  - No statistics, case studies, or concrete examples from any research

- **Organization is repetitive and circular - poor flow**:
  - Paragraph 1: Introduces filter bubbles → mentions political polarization and cyberbullying
  - Paragraph 2: Discusses political topics and arguments (repeats paragraph 1 ideas)
  - Paragraph 3: Proposes solutions
  - Paragraph 4: Discusses pros (this should come much earlier, right after paragraph 1)
  - Paragraph 5: Goes back to cyberbullying (already mentioned in paragraph 1)
  - The paper keeps circling back to the same points without developing them deeper

- **Vague, unsupported claims throughout**:
  - Paragraph 5: "people's lives could be ruined" - needs evidence from research
  - Paragraph 5: "could just get bullied online" - needs research support about filter bubbles causing cyberbullying
  - Paragraph 2: "These three sites basically explain..." - which three? You only named two sources
  - Paragraph 2: "there are always two sides in a political topic" - oversimplification

- **No counterargument or complexity**:
  - Doesn't acknowledge any benefits that platforms might argue for personalized feeds
  - Doesn't address why platforms use these algorithms (business model, user engagement)
  - No engagement with opposing views

- **Solutions are underdeveloped** (Paragraph 3):
  - "recommend both sides" - how would this work technically? Is this feasible?
  - "turn the recommendation system on or off" - what research supports this as effective?
  - No critical examination of whether these solutions would actually work or have been tried

### Writing Quality & Mechanics: 6/10 (Needs Improvement - D range)

**Strengths:**
- Generally readable with a conversational approach
- Clear paragraph structure
- Attempts to engage the reader directly

**Areas for Improvement:**

**Grammar & Style:**
- Run-on sentences need revision (e.g., lines 126-136 is one very long sentence)
- Avoid informal language in academic writing:
  - "huge deal" (line 123) → "significant feature"
  - "basically" (line 147) → remove or use "essentially"
  - "people don't have a clue of" (line 151) → "people are uninformed about"
- Reduce repetition: "social media" appears excessively; use pronouns or varied phrasing
- Eliminate wordiness: "people's lives could be ruined because of what they see online and what people they interact with online" can be more concise

**APA Format - CRITICAL ISSUES:**
- **No in-text citations anywhere in the paper** - this is a major problem
- Every paraphrase or quote from a source needs: (Author, Year) or (Author, Year, p. X)
- Reference list format has errors:
  - Don't number references - alphabetize them
  - Cinelli citation: needs DOI and proper journal formatting
  - Duskin citation: needs proper arXiv formatting or URL
  - Inconsistent punctuation and formatting

**Voice:**
- Shifts between academic and casual tone
- Maintain professional voice throughout (avoid "you" and "your")

**Polish:**
- This reads like an early draft
- Needs substantial revision before it's ready for submission

**Specific Examples:**
- Line 147: "He basically warns people that..." → "Pariser (2011) warns that..."
- Line 153: "An article called 'The echo chamber effect on social media' talks about..." → "Cinelli et al. (2021) found that..."

### Recommendations for Revision:

**CRITICAL PRIORITY - Must Fix:**

1. **Add in-text citations throughout the entire paper** - This is the most serious issue. Every time you mention an idea from a source, you MUST cite it:
   - **Paragraph 2**: "A book that was written by a person named Pariser in 2011..." → "Pariser (2011) demonstrates how..."
   - **Paragraph 2**: "An article called 'The echo chamber effect on social media'..." → "Cinelli et al. (2021) found that..."
   - **Every paragraph** that discusses source material needs citations
   - Without in-text citations, this is considered plagiarism, even unintentional

2. **Fix the reference list to proper APA 7th edition format**:
   - Remove the numbering (1., 2., 3.)
   - Add DOI for Cinelli et al.: https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2023301118
   - Format Duskin et al. as arXiv preprint with proper citation
   - Use hanging indent format

**High Priority - Content & Organization:**

3. **Add depth - explain what your sources actually found**:
   - **Paragraph 2**: What specific data or statistics did Cinelli et al. provide about echo chambers?
   - **Paragraph 2**: What concrete examples does Pariser give in his book?
   - **Paragraph 2**: What did Duskin et al. discover in their Twitter audit? You list this source but never actually discuss it
   - Include specific studies, statistics, or case studies from your research
   - Right now you mention sources but never explain their findings

4. **Eliminate repetition - develop each paragraph more fully** (keep your current sequence, just deepen each section):
   - **Paragraph 1**: You introduce political polarization and cyberbullying here
   - **Paragraph 2**: You discuss political topics again (repetitive) - instead, provide specific evidence and deepen the analysis
   - **Paragraph 5**: You return to cyberbullying (repetitive) - instead of repeating points, provide research evidence the first time you mention them
   - Each paragraph should develop a new idea with evidence, not circle back to previous points without adding depth

5. **Develop your solutions with critical analysis** (**Paragraph 3**):
   - How would "recommending both sides" work technically?
   - Has this been tried? What does research say about its effectiveness?
   - Are there drawbacks to your proposed solutions?
   - Support solutions with research, not just your opinions

6. **Add counterargument and complexity**:
   - Why do platforms use these algorithms? (business reasons, user engagement)
   - What benefits do platforms claim for personalized feeds?
   - Address opposing views, then refute them with evidence

**Medium Priority - Writing Quality:**

6. **Revise informal language for academic tone**:
   - "huge deal" (line 123) → "significant concern"
   - "basically" (line 147) → remove or use "demonstrates"
   - "people don't have a clue of" (line 149) → "people are uninformed about"
   - Avoid "you" and "your" - use third person

7. **Fix run-on sentences**:
   - Lines 126-136 is one extremely long sentence - break into 3-4 sentences
   - Lines 138-143 also needs to be broken up

8. **Reduce wordiness and repetition**:
   - "social media" appears excessively - use pronouns or "these platforms"
   - "In general" appears multiple times - vary transitions

## Hunter Mongeon - "Dating App Algorithms and Racial Bias"

**Total Score: 18/20 (90% - A)**

### Content Quality & Clarity: 9/10 (Excellent - A range)

**Strengths:**
- **Sharp, focused thesis**: The research question (lines 28-32) and thesis statement (lines 34-42) are clear, specific, and well-articulated
- **Strong evidence**: Uses five credible, diverse sources including:
  - Peer-reviewed research (Arranz Aldana & Salazar 2024)
  - Legal scholarship (De Jonge & Zuiderveen Borgesius 2024)
  - Journalism (Hutson et al. 2019, Harding 2024)
  - Lived experience research (Kalra et al. 2023)
- **Excellent organization**: Logical flow with clear, well-developed sections:
  - Introduction establishing context and significance
  - Algorithmic learning mechanisms
  - Structural/design bias
  - Legal and ethical analysis
  - Lived experiences
  - Counterargument (demonstrates critical thinking)
  - Conclusion with recommendations
- **Deep understanding**: Goes beyond surface description to analyze how algorithms work, why they produce biased outcomes, and what can be done
- **Sophisticated synthesis**: Sources are integrated throughout to build an argument rather than listed separately
- **Critical thinking**: The counterargument section (lines 158-192) shows engagement with opposing views and refutes them thoughtfully
- **Original insights**: Connects algorithmic bias to broader social inequalities

**Minor Areas for Improvement:**
- While the analysis is strong, 1-2 more concrete examples or data points could strengthen abstract concepts
- Some transitions between sections could be slightly smoother
- The lived experiences section is powerful but could connect more explicitly back to the algorithmic mechanisms discussed earlier

### Writing Quality & Mechanics: 9/10 (Excellent - A range)

**Strengths:**

**Grammar & Style:**
- Virtually error-free prose
- Sophisticated sentence variety creates engaging rhythm:
  - "Over time, the feed becomes repetitive, almost like an echo chamber, showing users the same types of profiles they've already responded to" (lines 68-70)
  - "These tools make it incredibly easy to exclude entire racial groups with almost no effort" (lines 86-88)
- Clear, precise language
- Smooth transitions between ideas

**Voice:**
- Consistent professional academic tone throughout
- Appropriate level of formality
- Avoids both overly casual and unnecessarily dense language

**Structure:**
- Proper APA student paper heading (lines 1-7)
- Well-developed paragraphs with clear topic sentences
- Effective use of sectional organization

**APA Format:**
- **In-text citations present** throughout:
  - (Aldana & Salazar, 2024) - line 55
  - (Hutson et al., 2019) - line 82
  - (De Jonge & Zuiderveen Borgesius, 2024) - line 110
  - (Kalra et al., 2023) - line 138
- References section included (lines 222-246)

**Polish:**
- Near publication-ready quality
- Demonstrates careful revision and editing

**Areas for Improvement:**

**APA Reference List Issues** (this is what prevents a perfect score):
- References should **not be numbered** - remove the numbers
- Some citations are incomplete:
  - #1 (Arranz Aldana): Missing journal title, volume, pages, DOI
  - #2 (De Jonge): Title formatting and full citation details needed
  - #3 (Hutson): Journal article or website? Needs proper format
  - #4 (Harding): Needs proper website citation format with retrieval date if needed
  - #5 (Kalra): This appears to be an arXiv preprint but description suggests Bumble study - verify source
- References should be in **hanging indent** format
- Inconsistent use of URLs - include DOIs when available
- Should be alphabetized by author last name (currently is, but formatting needs work)

**Minor Typo:**
- Line 158: "Counterarguement" → "Counterargument"

**Specific Reference Format Examples:**

Current (line 224-225):
```
1. Arranz Aldana A (2024). Racial preferences in dating apps: an experimental approach.
```

Should be:
```
Arranz Aldana, A., & Salazar, L. (2024). Racial preferences in dating apps: An experimental approach.
    Journal Name, Volume(Issue), pages. https://doi.org/XX.XXXX/xxxxx
```

### Recommendations for Revision:

1. **Fix reference list formatting** - This is the main issue preventing a higher score:
   - Remove numbers
   - Add hanging indents
   - Complete all citation information (journal, volume, pages, DOI)
   - Verify and correct the Kalra citation
2. **Fix the typo** on line 158
3. **Optional enhancements**:
   - Add 1-2 specific statistics or examples to strengthen abstract arguments
   - Consider slightly smoother transitions between major sections
   - Explicitly connect the lived experiences section back to earlier algorithmic analysis

### Overall Assessment:

This is an excellent first draft that demonstrates strong research, critical thinking, and writing skills. The analysis is sophisticated, the sources are well-integrated, and the writing is clear and engaging. The main weakness is the APA reference formatting, which is relatively easy to fix. With minor revisions, this could be an outstanding paper.

## General Notes

All three papers demonstrate engagement with their topics, but they are at different stages of development:

- **Hunter's paper (A)** is already excellent and needs only APA reference list formatting corrections and minor polish
- **Isaac's paper (B)** is solid with good APA citation practices; needs nuanced treatment of claims, a counterargument section, and removal of informal language to move into A range
- **Jackson's paper (D)** needs substantial revision in both content integration and APA formatting, particularly the complete absence of in-text citations

**Important reminder for all students**: APA in-text citations are **mandatory** for all ideas, facts, or information that come from your sources. This is not optional in academic writing. Every time you paraphrase, summarize, or quote from a source, you must cite it.
