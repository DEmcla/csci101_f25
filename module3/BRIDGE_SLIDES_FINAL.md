## NEW SLIDE: ARPANET Growth and Impact (1969-1973)

**Early Growth:**
- **1969:** 4 nodes (UCLA, SRI, UCSB, Utah)
- **1970:** 13 nodes across United States
- **1971:** 23 nodes – email invented (becomes the "killer app")
- **1973:** 40 nodes

**Key Developments:**
- Network Control Protocol (NCP) enables host-to-host communication
- First public demonstration of ARPANET (1972)
- Proves packet switching works at scale

**Impact:**
- Researchers share resources and collaborate remotely
- Demonstrates viability of distributed networking
- Inspires parallel development of other technologies

## NEW SLIDE: The Challenge of Local Networks

**ARPANET Success Created New Questions:**

**Wide Area Networks (WANs) – SOLVED:**
- ARPANET connected distant computers across country
- Packet switching over long-distance telephone lines
- Worked well for research institutions

**Local Area Networks (LANs) – UNSOLVED:**
- How to connect multiple computers in same building or campus?
- Different requirements than long-distance networking
- Need: Cost-effective way to share resources locally

**The Problem:**
- ARPANET's IMP technology expensive for local use
- Needed simpler, cheaper solution for connecting nearby computers
- Market opportunity: businesses and universities wanted local networking

## NEW SLIDE: Parallel Innovations (Early 1970s)

**Multiple Networking Approaches Emerging:**

**University of Hawaii – ALOHAnet (1971):**
- Used radio waves to connect computers across Hawaiian islands
- Random access protocol – devices transmit when they have data
- If collision occurs, wait and retry
- Inspired Ethernet's design

**Xerox PARC:**
- Palo Alto Research Center working on "office of the future"
- Vision: multiple computers, printers, servers sharing resources
- Need: reliable local area networking technology
- Robert Metcalfe assigned to solve this problem

**The Stage is Set:**
By 1973, the groundwork was laid for Ethernet revolution

## NEW SLIDE: Setting the Stage for Standardization

**By Early 1970s:**

**What Was Working:**
✓ Packet switching proven in ARPANET
✓ Distributed routing demonstrated
✓ Remote resource sharing enabled
✓ Open protocols showing value

**What Was Missing:**
✗ No standards for local area networks
✗ No standardized way to interconnect different networks
✗ Each organization developing custom solutions
✗ Limited interoperability between systems

**The Need:**
- Universal protocols that work across different network types
- Standards for internetworking (connecting networks together)
- This need would drive innovations throughout the 1970s
