# HOSTS.TXT Slide - Insert After Slide 13 (ARPANET 1973)

## NEW SLIDE: The HOSTS.TXT Problem (Early 1970s)

**As ARPANET Grew, Name Resolution Became a Challenge:**

**The Solution (Initially):**
- HOSTS.TXT file – mapped hostnames to IP addresses
- Maintained centrally by SRI-NIC (Stanford Research Institute's Network Information Center)
- Administrators emailed changes to NIC
- Updated once or twice weekly
- All hosts downloaded the file via FTP from SRI-NIC

**Growing Pains (Late 1970s):**
- File size grew with each new host (40+ nodes = management nightmare)
- Network traffic from updates overwhelming SRI-NIC
- Single point of failure – if SRI-NIC down, name resolution stops
- Updates only weekly – delays in adding new hosts

**The Fix:**
- **1983:** DNS (Domain Name System) introduced
- Decentralized, hierarchical solution
- Dynamic query resolution instead of static file distribution

## INSERTION LOCATION:

**Insert this slide AFTER Slide 13 (ARPANET 1973 node list)**

This creates a smooth transition:
- Slide 13: Shows 40+ nodes in 1973
- **NEW Slide 14: HOSTS.TXT Problem** ← explains scalability issue
- Current Slide 14 (becomes 15): "Wide Area Networks (WANs) Solved"

**After insertion, your presentation will have 46 slides total.**

## RATIONALE:

This slide:
- Demonstrates how network growth drove innovation
- Shows practical problems that emerged from success
- Sets up why standardization was needed
- Introduces DNS as a solution (referenced again in 1983 section)
- Illustrates "single point of failure" vs distributed design principles
