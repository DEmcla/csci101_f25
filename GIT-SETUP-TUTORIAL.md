## Part 4: Fork the Course Repository

### Step 4.1: Find the Course Repository
1. Go to your instructor's repository:
   ```
   https://github.com/[INSTRUCTOR_USERNAME]/csci101_f25
   ```
2. You should see the course repository with project-step folders

### Step 4.2: Fork It!
1. Click the "Fork" button (top-right of the page)
2. If asked "Where should we fork?", click your username
3. Wait a few seconds...
4. You now have YOUR OWN COPY! The URL will be:
   ```
   https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/csci101_f25
   ```

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: You're now on YOUR fork, not the instructor's repository!

---

## Part 5: Clone to Your Computer

### Step 5.1: Get Your Fork's URL
1. On YOUR fork (check the URL has your username)
2. Click the green "Code" button
3. Make sure "HTTPS" is selected
4. Click the copy button to copy the URL

### Step 5.2: Clone It
1. Open your terminal/Git Bash
2. Navigate to where you want to store your coursework:
   ```bash
   # Windows example:
   cd /c/Users/YourName/Documents
   
   # Mac example:
   cd ~/Documents
   ```
3. Clone your repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/csci101_f25.git
   ```
4. Enter the folder:
   ```bash
   cd csci101_f25
   ```

### Step 5.3: Verify You're in the Right Place
```bash
ls
```
You should see:
```
project-step-1/
project-step-2/
project-step-3/
... etc
README.md
SUBMISSION-INSTRUCTIONS.md
```

## Part 6: Connect to Instructor's Repository

### Step 6.1: Add Upstream Remote
Replace `INSTRUCTOR_USERNAME` with your instructor's GitHub username:
```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/INSTRUCTOR_USERNAME/csci101_f25.git
```

### Step 6.2: Verify Your Remotes
```bash
git remote -v
```
You should see:
```
origin    https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/csci101_f25.git (fetch)
origin    https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/csci101_f25.git (push)
upstream  https://github.com/INSTRUCTOR_USERNAME/csci101_f25.git (fetch)
upstream  https://github.com/INSTRUCTOR_USERNAME/csci101_f25.git (push)
```

**What this means:**
- `origin` = Your fork (where you push your work)
- `upstream` = Instructor's repository (where you submit via Pull Request)

## Part 7: Practice Submission

Let's do a practice run with a simple text file before your real assignment!

### Step 7.1: Create a Practice Branch
```bash
git checkout -b practice_firstname_lastname
```
Replace with your actual name, for example:
```bash
git checkout -b practice_john_smith
```

### Step 7.2: Create a Practice File
1. Create a simple text file:
   ```bash
   # Windows (Git Bash):
   echo "This is my practice submission" > practice/Practice_John_Smith.txt
   
   # Mac/Linux:
   echo "This is my practice submission" > practice/Practice_John_Smith.txt
   ```

2. Verify it was created:
   ```bash
   ls practice/
   ```

### Step 7.3: Add and Commit
```bash
# See what changed
git status

# Add your file
git add practice/Practice_John_Smith.txt

# Commit with message
git commit -m "Add practice submission - John Smith"
```

### Step 7.4: Push to Your Fork
```bash
git push origin practice_john_smith
```

You might be prompted for your GitHub username and password:
- Username: Your GitHub username
- Password: You need a Personal Access Token (not your password!)
  - Go to GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens
  - Generate new token (classic)
  - Select "repo" scope
  - Copy and use this as your password

## Part 8: Create Your First Pull Request

### Step 8.1: Go to GitHub
1. Go to YOUR fork on GitHub
2. You should see a yellow banner: "practice_john_smith had recent pushes"
3. Click "Compare & pull request"

**If you don't see the banner:**
1. Click "Pull requests"
2. Click "New pull request"
3. Make sure the settings are:
   - Base repository: `INSTRUCTOR_USERNAME/csci101_f25`
   - Base: `main`
   - Head repository: `YOUR_USERNAME/csci101_f25`
   - Compare: `practice_john_smith`

### Step 8.2: Create the Pull Request
1. Title: `Practice Submission - John Smith`
2. Description (optional): "This is my practice submission for the Git tutorial"
3. Click "Create pull request"

### Step 8.3: Success!
You should see your pull request created! The URL will be something like:
```
https://github.com/INSTRUCTOR_USERNAME/csci101_f25/pull/1
```

## Part 9: Your Real Assignment Workflow

Now you're ready for actual assignments! Here's the workflow:

### Before Each Assignment:
```bash
# Get any updates from instructor
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main
git push origin main
```

### For Each Assignment:
```bash
# 1. Create a new branch
git checkout -b step1_john_smith

# 2. Add your assignment file to the correct folder
# (Put your Word doc in project-step-1/ folder)

# 3. Add and commit
git add project-step-1/Project_John_Smith.docx
git commit -m "Add Step 1 submission - John Smith"

# 4. Push
git push origin step1_john_smith

# 5. Go to GitHub and create Pull Request
```

## 🚨 Common Problems and Solutions

### "Permission denied" when pushing
- **Cause**: Trying to push to instructor's repo instead of your fork
- **Fix**: Check your remotes with `git remote -v`

### "Fatal: not a git repository"
- **Cause**: You're not in the right folder
- **Fix**: `cd` into your csci101_f25 folder

### Can't find Git Bash (Windows)
- **Fix**: Search "Git Bash" in Start Menu, or reinstall Git

### "Please tell me who you are" error
- **Fix**: Run the config commands from Part 3

### Password authentication was removed
- **Fix**: Use a Personal Access Token instead of password
- Create at: GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens
